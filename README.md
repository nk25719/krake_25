# Krake™

Based upon the Public Invention General Purpose Alarm Device (GPAD), the Krake is a wireless annunciator and alarm device designed to alert humans to conditions requiring attention. The Krake combines visual, audible, serial, and network alarm communication into an open-source hardware and firmware platform.

The Krake extends the original GPAD architecture with:

* ESP32-based networking
* MQTT communication
* Rotary encoder navigation
* 20x4 LCD interface
* DFPlayer audio playback
* Persistent configuration storage
* OTA firmware updates
* Configurable COM port
* Alarm queue handling
* GPAP alarm messaging

# Use Cases

The Krake is intended to inform human operators of alarm conditions requiring attention.

## Healthcare and Assisted Living

One intended use case is monitoring elderly individuals or patients living independently. A Krake device mounted within a residence may announce:

* Falls
* Blood pressure abnormalities
* Sensor-triggered emergencies
* Medical equipment alarms

The Krake is intended to support interoperability with the HL7 medical standard and the open-source ADaM (Alarm Dialog Management) project.

## Medical Devices

The Krake may function as a dedicated annunciator for sophisticated medical equipment such as ventilators or patient monitoring systems.

Examples include:

* Ventilator hose disconnects
* Power failures
* Pressure abnormalities
* Mechanical faults

The Krake focuses on annunciation and communication, while upstream systems determine alarm conditions.

## Industrial and General Annunciation

Potential applications include:

* Schools
* Factories
* Industrial process monitoring
* Smart buildings
* Emergency notification systems
* Accessibility alerting systems

---

# Current Firmware Features

The current Krake firmware includes:

* Wi-Fi station + captive portal support
* MQTT alarm communication
* GPAP message parsing
* Rotary encoder navigation
* LCD menu system
* Alarm acknowledgement workflow
* Alarm queue handling
* DFPlayer audio annunciation
* Persistent COM configuration
* Mute timeout handling
* OTA firmware updates
* LittleFS configuration storage
* Alarm state persistence
* RS-232 controller interface
* Hardware flow control support
* LED annunciation patterns
* SPI alarm input support

---

# Smart LCD User Interface

The Krake includes a 20x4 I²C LCD interface integrated with a rotary encoder and custom menu system.

## LCD Features

* Real-time alarm display
* Alarm queue indication
* Wi-Fi status indication
* MQTT broker status indication
* Volume and mute display
* Alarm acknowledgement actions
* Rotary encoder navigation
* Settings configuration menu

## Planned LCD Layout

```text
Q:+ NEXT        W B M ⚙
CRIT Pump Failure
ID:123 Temp High
Ack  Dismiss  Shelve
```

## LCD Navigation

### Rotary Encoder

* Rotate:

  * Navigate alarms or menu entries
* Short Press:

  * Select item
* Long Press:

  * Open Settings Menu

### Alarm Actions

When an alarm is active:

* Rotate encoder to enter action selection
* Available actions:

  * Acknowledge
  * Dismiss
  * Shelve

### Settings Menu

The local settings menu includes:

* Volume Level
* Mute Duration
* COM Setup
* Device Reset
* Exit Menu

---

# Wi-Fi Connectivity

The Krake normally operates as a Wi-Fi station connected to a local network.

For setup and provisioning, the Krake can create a temporary Wi-Fi access point using WiFiManager and LittleFS credential storage.

## Features

* Captive portal setup
* Multiple stored Wi-Fi credentials
* Automatic reconnection
* OTA firmware updates
* MQTT connectivity monitoring
* LCD network status display

Credentials are stored locally using LittleFS.

---

# MQTT Protocol

The Krake communicates using MQTT for alarm distribution and acknowledgement.

## Features

* MQTT alarm subscriptions
* GPAP response publishing
* Alarm acknowledgements
* Alarm dismissal and shelving
* Device monitoring
* Configurable topic subscriptions
* MQTT status display on LCD

Each Krake subscribes to alarm topics and publishes alarm responses on dedicated ACK topics.

## Example GPAP Responses

```text
oa{1234}   -> Acknowledge
od{1234}   -> Dismiss
os{1234}   -> Shelve
```
